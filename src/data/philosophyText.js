At InternDAO, we believe that a collective of individuals with a shared vision is the most powerful form of human organization. 

Internally, we focus our efforts on bringing together and facilitating exceptional people with exceptional skills. 

Every Intern possesses unique knowledge and skills, while also being accountable and communicative. 

The result is a decentralized, fluid organization where members work on what they want, when they want – setting timelines and goals for themselves while using the support of the community to achieve great outcomes.

Within the DAO, a standard framework is used that sets clear guidelines and expectations for every member. 

Contribution is fostered wherever possible, and there is a process for warning and removing Interns who no longer adhere to the framework of contribution, communication, and accountability. 

By leaning on a defined framework, we empower every Intern to be in charge of their own destiny.

While we don’t believe in traditional hierarchies, we do believe in organizational structure. 

There are no bosses or managers within InternDAO; however, there are members who take on additional responsibilities and become facilitators focused on teams and projects.`;
