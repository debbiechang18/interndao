Hi there,

My name is Mark Totte. I am a filmmaker living and working remote in Taos, NM.

I’ve spent my entire career working in either film, tv, or video production. I received a degree in film studies and got my start in LA working in the production industry. I’ve worked at studios spanning from LA, to Saint Louis, all the way down to Albuquerque. Aside from the #setlyfe hustle I also pursue a freelance career as a means to pay the bills and more importantly hone my own craft. I would consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to film/video production. I typically write, produce, direct, shoot, and edit all my work.

I’ve assisted on large movie sets, shot reality TV, directed films (including my first feature film which is currently in the festival circuit), and have created content for both corporate and small business clients.

I believe I am the ideal candidate you’re looking for. Not only do I possess the skills required for this role, but figure I have relevant and transferrable work experience. I spent 3 years in Detroit contracted with BOSCH where I worked in a business professional setting and was expected to uphold the necessary technical accuracy for all newly created content.
