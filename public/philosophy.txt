At InternDAO we believe that a collective of individuals with a shared vision is the most powerful form of human organization. 

Internally we focus our efforts on bringing together and facilitating exceptional people with exceptional skills. Every Intern has unique knowledge and skills, while also being accountable and communicative. 

The result is a decentralized fluid organization where members work on what they want, when they want – setting timelines and
goals for themselves while using the support of the community to achieve great outcomes.

Within the DAO a standard framework is used that sets clear guidelines and expectation for every member. 

Contribution is fostered wherever possible and there is a process for warning and removing Interns who no longer adhere to the framework of contribution, communication, and accountable. 

By leaning on a defined framework, we empower every Intern to be in charge
of their own destiny.

While we don’t believe in traditional hierarchies, we do believe in organizational structure.

There are no bosses nor managers within InternDAO, however there are members who take on additional responsibility and become facilitators focused on teams and projects.
